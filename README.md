# djs-command-resolver
By using this package, both `ComamndInteraction` and `Message` will be resolved as unified `CommandMessage` and you can code with `CommandMessage` with no considering the way the command passed.  
 ![this is what the package does](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56076195/157648893-e409de75-4c97-423f-8095-ddeeaca2bf21.png)
Therefore you can support Message-based-command and Interaction-based-command at once, without any verbose codes.  
  
This library was splitted from [mtripg6666tdr/Discord-SimpleMusicBot](https://github.com/mtripg6666tdr/Discord-SimpleMusicBot).  
  
You can see more by reading [API documentation](https://mtripg6666tdr.github.io/djs-command-resolver/) or directly reading [source folder](src/).
